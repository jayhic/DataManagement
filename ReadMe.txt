The final project was to use Medline data and construct an institutional research repository, an on-line information system housing descriptions of the activities of researchers.
My parts in the project were working at the command line to remotely set up an Apache Tomcat Instance and then transfer the files for our project to that server so it could be accessed. 
I wrote SQL queries to retrieve information from the database and made the Java pages where those results would be displayed.
